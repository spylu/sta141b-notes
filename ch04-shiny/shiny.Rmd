Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.

You can host 
- standalone apps on a webpage
- embed them in R Markdown documents
- build dashboards

I highly recommend you to visit https://shiny.rstudio.com/ for the documentation and gallery.


## Host

There are multiple way to host a shiny app.

- Install shiny server on a computer that you own
- Upload your app to https://www.shinyapps.io/
  - Each month you have 25 free active hours
  - Maximum 5 apps for free
- Google Cloud Run


## First Shiny App

There are couple ways to create an shiny app (we are going to focus on RStudio).

- File -> New File -> Shiny Web App
  - Single file (recommanded)
  - Multiple files (essentially the same as single file, but two files)
- File -> New File -> R Markdown -> Shiny
- File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Flex Dashboard (if `flexdashboard` was installed.)

## Basic Struture


```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  # controls the layout and content of the application
)


server <- function(input, output) {
  # controls the interaction, modifly output based on user input
}

# run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


We are going to use the tutorial in https://github.com/rstudio-education/shiny.rstudio.com-tutorial

## Reactivity

Reactivity maybe the most challenging part of learning shiny!

- `reactive()`
- `observe` and `observeEvent()`
- `eventReactive()`
- `isolate()`
- `reactiveVal()` and `reactiveValues`
