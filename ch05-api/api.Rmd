# API

This section lists some examples of public HTTP APIs that publish data in JSON format. These are great to get a sense of the complex structures that are encountered in real world JSON data.

See also https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis for a list of public APIs.

## CitiBike NYC

A single public API that shows location, status and current availability for all stations in the New York City bike sharing imitative. https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data


```{r}
citibike <- fromJSON("https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_status.json")
as_datetime(citibike$last_updated)
```


```{r}
stations <- citibike$data$stations
stations %>%
  filter(num_bikes_available > 0)
```

```{r}
nrow(stations)
```


## OnWater https://onwater.io/

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# davis
url <- str_glue("https://api.onwater.io/api/v1/results/{lat},{long}", lat = 38.54491, long = -121.74052)
fromJSON(url)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# lake tahoe
url <- str_glue("https://api.onwater.io/api/v1/results/{lat},{long}", lat = 39.0968, long = -120.0324)
fromJSON(url)
```


## Deck of Cards http://deckofcardsapi.com/

It is a very simple API which suffles cards.

```{r, out.width = "20%"}
# get a deck
deck <- fromJSON("https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=1")
deck_id <- deck$deck_id
```


```{r, out.width = "20%"}
# draw two cards
cards <- fromJSON(
  str_glue("https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/{deck_id}/draw/?count={count}",
    deck_id = deck$deck_id, count = 2
  ),
  flatten = TRUE
)
```


```{r, out.width = "20%"}
knitr::include_graphics(cards$cards$images.svg)
```

The paramenters after `?` are called GET parameters. A more formal way to handle GET parameters is to use the
`httr` package. 

```{r}
library(httr)
```

```{r}
endpoint <- str_glue("https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/{deck_id}/draw/", deck_id = deck$deck_id)
r <- GET(endpoint, query = list(count = 3))
json <- content(r, as = "text")
cards <- fromJSON(json, flatten = TRUE)
cards
```



## GeoDataSource https://www.geodatasource.com/

In this secton, we are going to show you how we use an API which requires an API key. API key allows you to use the services the API provides on behalf of yourself.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r <- GET(
  "https://api.geodatasource.com/cities",
  query = list(
    key = "YOUR PRIVATE API KEY",
    lat = 38.5449,
    lng = -121.741
  )
)

# check if the status is ok
stop_for_status(r)

json <- content(r, as = "text")
fromJSON(json)
```

# How to store your secrets

There are multiple ways to protect your API key.

- Make use of environment variables. Environment variables are stored in `.Renviron`.
You could put this file in various places.

  - Project home directory
  
    - `usethis::edit_r_environ("project")`
    
  - Under the same directory as the Rscript

    - Create a file called `.Renviron` in the same directory as your script and put your API key into it. 
    - You might need to import the keys manually by

```{r}
readRenviron(".Renviron")
```

In the file `.Renviron`, put
```
GEODATA_KEY="YOUR API KEY"
```


```{r}
# you might need to change your working directory and restart R session to make it work
r <- GET(
  "https://api.geodatasource.com/cities",
  query = list(
    key = Sys.getenv("GEODATA_KEY"),
    lat = 38.5449,
    lng = -121.741
  )
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text")
fromJSON(json)
```

- The other appoarch is to make use of the package `keyring`. (PS: this method doesn't work for shiny app)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# to set a secret, use
# only need to do it once, you will be prompted for the API key
# the password is stored in your system password manager
keyring::key_set("GEODATA_KEY")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r <- GET(
  "https://api.geodatasource.com/cities",
  query = list(
    key = keyring::key_get("GEODATA_KEY"),
    lat = 38.5449,
    lng = -121.741
  )
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text")
fromJSON(json)
```


# The Guardian News https://open-platform.theguardian.com/

```{r}
r <- GET(
  "https://content.guardianapis.com/search",
  query = list(
    `api-key` = Sys.getenv("GUARDIAN_KEY"),
    q = "coronavirus"
  )
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
result <- fromJSON(json)
result$response
```

Only 10 results?
```{r}
result$response$pages
```
There are many more pages! How to get the second page?


# Wolfram alpha

```{r}
r <- GET(
  "https://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query",
  query = list(
    appid = Sys.getenv("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_KEY"),
    input = "integrate x^3",
    format = "plaintext",
    output = "json"
  )
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")

fromJSON(json, flatten = TRUE)$queryresult$pods %>%
  hoist(subpods, text = "plaintext") %>%
  select(title, text) %>%
  unnest(text)
```


# Google map

You will need to register a google clould platfram account with $300 credit first.
THen following the instruction here to generate an api key.
https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key


```{r}
r <- GET(
  "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json",
  query = list(
    key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"),
    location = "38.5449,-121.741",
    radius = 500,
    types = "food",
    name = "in-n-out"
  )
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
fromJSON(json, flatten = TRUE)$results %>% pull(vicinity)
```


# GitHub API

GitHub requries API token instead of an API key.

```{r}
username <- "randy3k"
r <- GET(
  str_glue("https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos"),
  add_headers(Authorization = paste("token", Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")))
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text")
fromJSON(json)
```

Only 30 repos? How to go to next page?

```{r}
r$headers$link
```




# Yelp

Yelp requries Bearer token directory instead of an API token.

First, you will need to register an app on yelp: https://www.yelp.com/developers

```{r}
r <- GET(
  "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search",
  add_headers(Authorization = paste("Bearer", Sys.getenv("YELP_TOKEN"))),
  query = list(
    location = "Davis"
  )
)
stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text")
fromJSON(json)$businesses %>% select(name)
```



# Noun Project https://thenounproject.com/

The Noun Project uses one-legged OAuth 1.0 protocol to authenticate users.
In OAuth protocal, there are two important pieces of strings

- Client key
- Client key secret

```{r, out.width = "5%"}
nouns_app <- oauth_app(
  "nounproject",
  key = "ed652bdcd50a4496bbc2253a603b9e9b",
  secret = Sys.getenv("NOUN_SECRET")
)

get_nouns_api <- function(endpoint) {
  signature <- oauth_signature(endpoint, app = nouns_app)
  GET(endpoint, oauth_header(signature))
}

r <- get_nouns_api(
  str_glue("https://api.thenounproject.com/icons/{term}", term = "statistics")
)

stop_for_status(r)
json <- content(r, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")

icons <- fromJSON(json)$icons %>% pull(preview_url)
knitr::include_graphics(icons[1:10])
```


# Twitter

First, create an app at https://developer.twitter.com/. You will need to register a twitter developer account first.

Twitter allows an app to access information publicly available on Twitter via two legged OAuth.


```{r}
twitter_app <- oauth_app("twitter",
  key = "1vqbnsftUcNLucoVxQiWYnD2d",
  secret = Sys.getenv("TWITTER_SECRET")
)

twitter_token <- oauth2.0_token(
  oauth_endpoint(
    authorize = NULL,
    access = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token"
  ),
  twitter_app,
  client_credentials = TRUE
)
```


```{r}
# Where On Earth IDentifier
get_woeid <- function(city, country) {
  r <- GET(
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/trends/available.json",
    config(token = twitter_token)
  )

  stop_for_status(r)
  json <- content(r, as = "text")
  fromJSON(json) %>%
    filter(name == {{ city }}, country == {{ country }}) %>%
    pull(woeid)
}

get_trends <- function(woeid) {
  r <- GET(
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/trends/place.json",
    config(token = twitter_token),
    query = list(id = woeid)
  )

  stop_for_status(r)
  json <- content(r, as = "text")
  fromJSON(json)$trends[[1]]
}

woeid <- get_woeid("Sacramento", "United States")
get_trends(woeid) %>% select(name)
```

PS: There is `rtweet` package, no one, in practice, will directly work with twitter API.
